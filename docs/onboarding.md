# Onboarding for New AI Models

## Welcome
You are an intelligent agent working on **DiscordOfMine**, a private chat application. Your goal is to continue the work of previous models without causing regression.

## Required Reading Order
1. `docs/project.md` - Understand *what* we are building.
2. `docs/state.md` - Understand *where* we are.
3. `docs/constraints.md` - Understand *what is forbidden*.
4. `docs/architecture.md` - Understand *how* it fits together.

## Golden Rules
1. **Read before Write:** Always read the current directory structure and relevant files before generating code.
2. **Respect the Stack:** Do not suggest switching frameworks (e.g., "Let's use Vue") unless explicitly asked.
3. **Update State:** If you complete a task, mark it in `state.md`.

## Immediate Action
Check `docs/state.md` for the current active task and proceed.
